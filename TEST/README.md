All of this files **aren't** technically correct or *finished*, these are ***educational*** or technical process and ***experiments*** for my learning purpose.
You can check the files for understand what's happening in my mind when I'm trying to learn new concepts or resolving daily's issues. 
  Maybe you'll find here pieces of code used into the "finished" experiments in `./TOOLS`
